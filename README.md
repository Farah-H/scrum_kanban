    - Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
    - Working software over comprehensive documentation
    - customer collaboration over contract negotiation
    - responding to change over following a plan

- how does it link to Agile
    ```
    Scrum is a pre-defined development lifecycle based on agile principles. Agile methodologies promote a project-management process that encourages frequent inspection and adaptation, and a leadership philosophy using teamwork, self-organization and accountability

- Scum Artifacts - What are they, which ones do we use?
    - Product Backlog: An ordered list of everything that is known to be needed in a product, constantly evolving and never complete.
    - Sprint Backlog: List of everything that that the team commits to achieving in a given Sprint, once created no-one can add to the sprint backlog except the development team. If the team needs to drop an item, they must negotiate it with the product owner. 
    - Potentially Releasable Product Increment: 'Potentially Releasable' means it meets the team's DoD e.g fully tested. 

    We use all of these. 

- Scrum Ceremonies - list these out and the process
    ![](https://www.projectmanager.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/scrum-ceremony-3-768x274.jpg)

    - Scrum Ceremonies are meetings unique to SCRUM teams, which help ensure everyone is on the same page. 
- KEY - How have you implemented AGILE?
    - We have been implementing SCRUM, we have a product backlog, weekly sprint, daily scrum meetings (stand-up), sprint reviews throughout and at the end of the week and also sprint retrospective at the end of the week in the form of 121s. 
- What are the 3 amigos?

```
Business – What problem are we trying to solve?
Development – How might we build a solution to solve that problem?
Testing – What about this, what could possibly happen?
```
