# Agile, SCRUM and Kanban Notes
## Agile
- What are the 4 Values of Agile? 
    - Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
    - Working software over comprehensive documentation
    - customer collaboration over contract negotiation
    - responding to change over following a plan

## SCRUM
- The process

- how does it link to Agile
    ```
    Scrum is a pre-defined development lifecycle based on agile principles. Agile methodologies promote a project-management process that encourages frequent inspection and adaptation, and a leadership philosophy using teamwork, self-organization and accountability

- Scrum Roles - List these out and what they do
    - Product owner
        - holds the vision for the product, bridge between team and client
    - ScrumMaster
        - Ensures team is using SCRUM effectively 
    - Development Team
        - builds the product

- Scum Artifacts - What are they, which ones do we use?
    - Product Backlog: An ordered list of everything that is known to be needed in a product, constantly evolving and never complete.
    - Sprint Backlog: List of everything that that the team commits to achieving in a given Sprint, once created no-one can add to the sprint backlog except the development team. If the team needs to drop an item, they must negotiate it with the product owner. 
    - Potentially Releasable Product Increment: 'Potentially Releasable' means it meets the team's DoD e.g fully tested. 

    We use all of these! 

- Scrum Ceremonies - list these out and the process
    ![](https://www.projectmanager.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/scrum-ceremony-3-768x274.jpg)

    - Scrum Ceremonies are meetings unique to SCRUM teams, which help ensure everyone is on the same page. 
- KEY - How have you implemented AGILE?
    - We have been implementing SCRUM, we have a product backlog, weekly sprint, daily scrum meetings (stand-up), sprint reviews throughout and at the end of the week and also sprint retrospective at the end of the week in the form of 121s. 
- What are the 3 amigos?

```
Business – What problem are we trying to solve?
Development – How might we build a solution to solve that problem?
Testing – What about this, what could possibly happen?
```

### SCRUM Ceremonies
For ease, we'll refere to sprint planning, daily scrum, sprint review and sprint retrospective as 1,2,3 and 4 respectively. 

- What happens in each one?
    1. Team meets and decides what they need to complete in the coming sprint 
    2. team checks-in, makes sure they're on the same page
    3. team demos what they shipped in the sprint
    4. team reviews their work, identifying what they did well and what they can do to make the nesxt sprint better. 
- When does each ceremony happen?
    1. Before the sprint
    2. Daily, during the sprint
    3. after the sprint has been completed
    4. after the sprint review

- What questions are asked?
    1. What are we going to work on, and how are we going to do it?
    2. What did you do yesterday? what will you do today? are there any impediments in the way?
    3. What have we achieved in this sprint?
    4. What did we do well this sprint, what can we do to make the next sprint better?

- how long are they?
    1. 2x the length of the sprint in hours. e.g if the sprint is 2 weeks, the sprint planning should be 4 hours. 
    2. No more than 15 minutes.
    3. One hour per week of the sprint.
    4. No more than 1.5 h per two week sprint. 
- What are the objects? how does it relate to AGILE 4 pricinples?


### EPIC and USER Stories
- What is the Format?
__A user story is a tool used in Agile software development to capture a description of a software feature from an end-user perspective. A user story describes the type of user, what they want and why. A user story helps to create a simplified description of a requirement.__

__An epic is a large user story that cannot be delivered as defined within a single iteration or is large enough that it can be split into smaller user stories.__

- What other things go into a user story? You need an
    - Actor: which is the user, which can be a single person or a group of people, interacting with a process
    - System: which is the process that's required to reach the final outcome
    - Goal: which is the successful user outcome
- What is planning poker used for?
    - Planning Poker is an agile estimating and planning technique that is consensus based. To start a poker planning session, the product owner or customer reads an agile user story or describes a feature to the estimators. 
    - If all estimators selected the same value, that becomes the estimate. If not, the estimators discuss their estimates. The high and low estimators should especially share their reasons. After further discussion, each estimator reselects an estimate card, and all cards are again revealed at the same time.
- What is INVEST for? In relation to user stories
    - “I” ndependent (of all others)
    - “N” egotiable (not a specific contract for features)
    - “V” aluable (or vertical)
    - “E” stimable (to a good approximation)
    - “S” mall (so as to fit within an iteration)
    - “T” estable (in principle, even if there isn’t a test for it yet)

## Kanban 
- What is it?
    - Kanban is a visual system for managing work as it moves through a process. Kanban visualizes both the process (the workflow) and the actual work passing through that process. The goal of Kanban is to identify potential bottlenecks in your process and fix them so work can flow through it cost-effectively at an optimal speed or throughput.
- How does it relate to Agile?
    - Core principles are :
        1. Start With What You Do Now
        2. Agree to Pursue Incremental, Evolutionary Change
        3. Respect the Current Process, Roles & Responsibilities
        4. Encourage Acts of Leadership at All Levels
    - Enables workflow visualisation, limit work in process, feedback loops, make process policies explicit 
- how does IT COMPARE to Scrum - Kanban vs SCRUM, how is it different from Scrum?

```
Basically, Kanban can be applied to visualize and improve the flow of work, regardless of the methodology being used to do the work. 
Scrum is an iterative, incremental work method that provides a highly prescriptive way in which work gets completed. Scrum teams have defined processes, roles, ceremonies and artifacts. 
```
- In what situation should it be applied?
When you want to have more flexibility within sprints. When you want to have an agile-like workflow, but are using a different methodology.
